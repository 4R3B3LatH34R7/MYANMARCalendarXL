# MYANMARCalendarXL
Routines for Calculation and Conversion to and from other calendars to Myanmar Calendar

## Brief background
I am a member of several Facebook groups where people discuss and ask for help on topics related MS Excel.\
In those places, most of the frequent questions can quite easily be solved by Excel formulas, many a questions popped-up from time to time that managed to wake the curious cat in me.
One of the many of these questions is: "How do I change from Myanmar date to English Date?" or vice versa...\
The usual answer is "Add 638 to Myanmar year!" which is the only knowledge that I have for said conversion in all my 40something years.

So the desire to help them as well as to quench my own selfish thirst for knowledge led me to search for solutions to this particular question.

I found this [webpage](http://coolemerald.blogspot.com/2013/06/algorithm-program-and-calculation-of.html?m=1) by Mr. Yan Naing Aye.\
On the first read through, I was amazed by the awesomeness alone. The topic was very complicated for me at that time but the person behind it was extremely knowledgeable on the subject matter and explained everything quite clearly as I found out on later readings.\
I have other projects going on at the time I first found it, so I had to drop it for some time.\
Then when I can finally work on it, I have to read through everything again. Even now that I finished porting the Javascript on that page into a fully functional (yet pretty raw) VBA code, I am not ashamed to admit that I still do not fully understand the theory behind it.\
I write code in VBA for Excel just because I love VBA but not because I was trained to write VBA code and my Javascript knowledge is only part way through a codecademy free course. Therefore, trying to understand the data structures and the code is not very easy for me, however, I managed to finish it in about 1 week's time.\
This is not an excuse nor gloating my achievement but just recording what I have encountered. I have to say it out loud that, it was not hard but it just was not a walk in the park either.

This was taken yesterday on 03NOV2021.
