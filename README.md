Routines for Calculation and Conversion to and from other calendars to Myanmar Calendar

## Brief background
I am a member of several Facebook groups where people discuss and ask for help on topics related MS Excel.\
In those places, most of the frequent questions can quite easily be solved by Excel formulas, many a questions popped-up from time to time that managed to wake the curious cat in me.
One of the many of these questions is: "How do I change from Myanmar date to English Date?" or vice versa...\
The usual answer is "Add 638 to Myanmar year!" which is the only knowledge that I have for said conversion in all my 40something years.

So the desire to help them as well as to quench my own selfish thirst for knowledge led me to search for solutions to this particular question.
